  * 2/4 Seals function (Gold and Red)
* Cards are not automatically sorted in hand

### Known Errors

* Occasionally crashes on exit, this will not cause problems with your system, will automatically reboot

## Roadmap Ahead

Next demo should include basic jokers, editions, and (hopefully all) enhancements. There will be a non-shop way to get them to show them off. Touch controls should also be added here.

After that will come shop, tarots, and planets.

A Main Menu will be added after the shop.

Better animations will come over time, as will more and more Jokers.

This will likely be a long-term project. Currently I plan to add all gameplay features from the original Balatro, but that may not be possible for me to do without compromising. I hope to keep only one version for both new3DS and old3DS, but if required I may create 2 versions.

There is no plan to add the same level of animation/polish as the original. This project is intended as a demake of the game to run on Nintendo 3DS.

## Downloading

Just drag the latest release into the 3ds folder on your SD card! (CFW required)

Open homebrew launcher, then open "Lovepotion" (custom metadata coming after more than one round maybe)

"Build" instructions coming soon

No assets nor code was taken from Balatro for this project. All code was written by me.

The font used in this project (as was in Balatro) is [this free-to-use font by Daniel Linssen!](https://managore.itch.io/m6x11)

All sprites in this project were created by me in GIMP.

I do not own any of the characters depicted on the face card custom collab fanart.

Deltarune Face Card art for Hearts was heavily inspired by [this fanart by Feier Reife!](https://bsky.app/profile/feierreife.bsky.social/post/3lsdjoqzz4c2k)
