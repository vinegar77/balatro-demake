## Features

* No source code or assets from Balatro (not a port)
* Pixel art designed in a lower resolution for pixel-perfect 3DS display
* Runs on both New and Old 3DS systems!
* 38 Jokers to make every run unique!
* Music (temporary) and sfx!
* How many antes can you survive?

## Controls

* DPad L/R/U/D: Move cursor
* Tap A: Select/Deselect Card
* Hold A + DPad Left/Right: Drag card/joker
* X: Discard Selected Cards (No animation currently)
* Y: Play Selected Cards
* B: Change Card Sorting
* Start: Exit Game

## Current Version: 0.1.0 (In-Round Gameplay Demo)

### Current Content:

* In-round Balatro Gameplay, featuring jokers, enchanced cards, and editions
* Full card sprites for all playing cards, + all 38 Jokers, + all editions/enhancements.
* Start with 5 (6 if lucky!) jokers and a randomly-enhanced deck, new gameplay every reset!
* How many Antes can you last?
* No longer risk of crash on exit

### Features Missing

* No shop, consumables, blue/purple seals, or boss blinds, many jokers missing
  * 38/150 Jokers fully implemented
  * 42/150 Jokers have sprite art made
* Glass cards don't break currently
* No payout post round (as no shop makes that kind of useless...)
* No touch controls yet, to be added in 0.1.1
* All animations very basic/nonexistant in some cases
* No description text, knowledge from game or wiki required

### Known Errors

* Sound effects will seemingly randomly choose not to play
* After too many rounds, may crash with a lua framebuffer error, this is known and should be fixed in 0.1.1

## Roadmap Ahead

Touch controls will be the next update (0.1.1)!

After that will come consumables and boss blinds! Finally, next will be the shop at last, as well as joker+consumable descriptions.

A Main Menu will be added after the shop.

Better animations will come over time, as will more and more Jokers.

This will likely be a long-term project. Currently I plan to add all gameplay features from the original Balatro, but that may not be possible for me to do without compromising. I hope to keep only one version for both new3DS and old3DS, but if required I may create 2 versions.

There is no plan to add the same level of animation/polish as the original. This project is intended as a demake of the game to run on Nintendo 3DS. I'll try to give it it's own charm, however :)

## Downloading

Just drag the latest .3dsx release into the 3ds folder on your SD card! (CFW required)

Too lazy to create a CIA for this demo, sorry. (I doubt you'd want to install a demo regardless...)

Open homebrew launcher, then open Balatro Demake!

"Build" instructions coming soon
